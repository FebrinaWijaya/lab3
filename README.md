Part B:
For 1000 elements, the time required for "sort" is 0.000917s, while the time required for "insertion sort" is 0.041049s.
For 10000 elements, the time required for "sort" is 0.011412s, while the time required for "insertion sort" is 4.33937s.
For 100000 elements, the time required for "sort" is 0.157498s while the time required for "insertion sort" is 345.642s.
Meanwhile, for 1000000 elements, it takes 1.42836s to complete sorting using "sort" function, but it takes a very long time to complete the sorting using insertion sort. I have waited for more than 2 hours and it hasn't been done yet, and I don't plan to wait any longer.

From those result, here is my conclusion:
For a big data like what we tested in this lab, the time required to complete the sorting using "sort" function is much less than the time required to complete sorting using "insertion sort" function. It concludes that it is more efficient to use sort function rather than insertion sort function.
